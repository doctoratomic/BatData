# BatData
This was a script requested by my dad to be able to edit JSON data. Or to create his own from scratch.

I'm more comfortable with Python so I decided to make the attempt this way. The `.js` file is an attempt to write the same script in JavaScript.

# Features

- Houses a database of supervillains
- Can add new data to .JSON file
- Can list the data in full
- Can delete data (though in my testing, I find it does the reverse of what I wanted it to. Instead of selecting the one to delete. It instead deletes everything but the selected file. Use with caution.)
